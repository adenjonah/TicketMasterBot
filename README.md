# Ticketmaster Bot

Ticketmaster Bot is a Discord bot designed to alert users every time a new event becomes available on Ticketmaster. Built for a ticket resale company based in NYC, it ensures users receive timely updates about upcoming events and provides powerful tools for managing event notifications.

## Features
- **Event Alerts**: Automatically notifies a Discord server when new events are added to Ticketmaster.

- **User Commands**:
  - `!next`: Displays events with tickets going on sale next.\

  - `!addartist <artistID>`: Marks an artist as notable, sending their events to a dedicated high-profile channel.\

- **API Crawlers**: Continuously fetch new events from Ticketmasterâ€™s API for four regions in North America.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Hosting**: [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
- **APIs**:
  - [Ticketmaster Discovery API](https://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/discovery-api/v2/)
  - [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference)
- **Deployment**: CI/CD pipeline auto-deploys updates to Heroku from GitHub.

## Architecture

The project is composed of two key components:
1. **API Crawlers**: Four Python scripts, each assigned to a specific North American region, poll the Ticketmaster API every minute and store new events in a PostgreSQL database.
2. **Bot Script**: The Discord bot retrieves unsent events from the database, posts them in designated channels, and handles user commands.\
   Example request:\
   `https://app.ticketmaster.com/discovery/v2/events?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&source=ticketmaster&locale=*&size=199&page=1&onsaleStartDateTime=2024-12-27T00:00:00Z&classificationId=CONCERTS&onsaleOnAfterStartDate=DATE&sort=onSaleStartDate,asc&latlong=CENTER&radius=DIST&unit=miles`

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Rate Limits**: The Ticketmaster API enforces a rate limit of 1000 events returned per query.\

  - **Solution**: Run five separate Heroku servers (four crawlers and one bot) to distribute requests and avoid exceeding rate limits.\

- **Storage Efficiency**: Optimized database structure to handle high-frequency updates and large datasets effectively.\

## Future Development
- Expand coverage to include events from other continents.
- Optimize database queries for better performance.
- Add new Discord commands and enhance logging mechanisms.
- Improve bot scalability and error handling.

## Usage
- Add the bot to your [Discord server](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/adding-your-bot-to-servers.html#bot-invite-links).
- Configure the database with your Ticketmaster API regions and preferences via environment variables.
- Start receiving real-time alerts and use commands like `!next` and `!addartist` to interact with the bot.
