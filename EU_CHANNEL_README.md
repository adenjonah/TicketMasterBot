# European Event Channel Fix

This update addresses an issue with routing European events to a dedicated Discord channel. The changes focus on ensuring that events with `region='eu'` are properly sent to the configured European channel.

## üêõ Bug Fixes

1. **SQL Query Fix**
   - Fixed a SQL error in the count query that was causing the notification process to fail
   - Replaced the complex query transformation with a simple dedicated COUNT query

2. **Region Filtering**
   - Updated region filtering to use case-insensitive comparison (`LOWER(Events.region) = 'eu'`)
   - Added more detailed logging to help diagnose region filtering issues

3. **European Channel Configuration**
   - Added proper configuration for the European channel
   - Added fallback to secondary channel if European channel is not configured

## üß∞ Utility Scripts

Several utility scripts were created to help manage European events:

### 1. `fix_eu_events.py`
- Ensures all European events (region='eu') are marked as unsent
- Provides statistics and sample events to verify the update

### 2. `fix_european_regions.py`
- Updates events from the European events JSON file to have region='eu'
- Checks for and adds the region column if it doesn't exist

### 3. `deploy_eu_channel_fix.sh`
- Deployment script that applies all European channel fixes
- Updates environment configuration, database schema, and restarts services

## üìã Manual Steps

If the automatic deployment script doesn't work, you can manually:

1. Add `EUROPEAN_CHANNEL=<your_channel_id>` to your `.env` file
2. Run the database schema update: `python database/schema_update.py`
3. Fix European events: `python fix_eu_events.py`
4. Restart the bot

## üîç Verification

After deploying these changes, verify that:

1. The bot logs show "Checking for European events to send to channel ID: X"
2. The SQL COUNT query executes successfully without errors
3. European events are being sent to the correct channel
4. European events have a purple color and "Region: Europe" in the footer

If any issues persist, check the logs for specific errors and ensure that the `Events` table has a `region` column with proper values.
