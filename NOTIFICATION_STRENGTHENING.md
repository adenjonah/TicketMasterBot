# Strengthened Discord Notification System

## ‚ùå **Previous Issue**
Events were being marked as `sentToDiscord = TRUE` even when they never actually reached Discord channels due to:
- Network errors during sending
- Discord API failures (rate limits, permissions, etc.)
- URL validation errors
- Any exception after the send attempt

This caused events to "disappear" - they were marked as sent but never appeared in Discord.

## ‚úÖ **New Strengthened System**

### 1. **Verified Delivery Confirmation**
```python
# OLD: Marked as sent immediately after send attempt
await channel.send(embed=embed)
await conn.execute("UPDATE Events SET sentToDiscord = TRUE WHERE eventID = $1", event_id)

# NEW: Only mark as sent if message object confirms delivery
message = await channel.send(embed=embed)
if message and message.id:
    # Only mark as sent if Discord confirms receipt
    await conn.execute("UPDATE Events SET sentToDiscord = TRUE WHERE eventID = $1", event_id)
```

### 2. **Attempt Tracking System**
New database columns added:
- `notification_attempts` - Counter of how many times we've tried to send
- `last_notification_attempt` - Timestamp of last attempt
- `notification_error` - Details of the most recent error

### 3. **Smart Retry Logic**
- **Maximum 3 attempts** per event to prevent infinite loops
- **Permanent errors** (bad URLs, malformed embeds) are marked as sent to avoid retries
- **Transient errors** (network issues, rate limits) allow retries
- **Permission errors** don't mark as sent (can be fixed by admin)

### 4. **Error Classification**
```python
permanent_errors = [
    "Not a well formed URL",
    "Invalid Form Body", 
    "Request entity too large",
    "Embed title is too long",
    "Embed description is too long"
]
```

### 5. **Enhanced Query Filtering**
Events are only selected for notification if:
```sql
WHERE Events.sentToDiscord = FALSE
    AND (Events.notification_attempts IS NULL OR Events.notification_attempts < 3)
```

## üîß **New Monitoring Tools**

### Notification Failure Checker
```bash
./check_notification_failures.py
```

This script provides:
- Events that have never been attempted
- Events with failed attempts and error details  
- Events that have reached max attempts (permanent failures)
- Summary by region
- Common error types

### Enhanced Logging
- Success confirmations include Discord message ID
- Detailed error categorization (permanent vs transient)
- Warnings when events reach max attempts
- Summary reports after each notification cycle

## üìä **Expected Behavior Changes**

### Before:
- Events marked as sent even on failures ‚Üí Lost events
- No retry mechanism ‚Üí Transient failures were permanent
- No error tracking ‚Üí Difficult to diagnose issues
- Silent failures ‚Üí No visibility into problems

### After:
- **Only successful deliveries marked as sent** ‚Üí No lost events
- **Automatic retries for transient failures** ‚Üí Network issues self-heal
- **Detailed error tracking** ‚Üí Easy to diagnose and fix issues
- **Comprehensive monitoring** ‚Üí Full visibility into notification health

## üö® **Breaking Changes**
None! The system is backward compatible. Existing events without the new columns will work normally, and the new columns will be automatically added during database initialization.

## üîç **How to Monitor**

### Check for stuck events:
```bash
./check_notification_failures.py
```

### Monitor logs for:
- `"Successfully sent event X to Discord (message ID: Y)"` - Confirmed deliveries
- `"Warning: X events have reached max notification attempts"` - Permanent failures
- `"Transient Discord error for event X"` - Temporary issues that will retry

### Deploy and test:
After deployment, you should see:
1. More events actually appearing in Discord (previously lost events now delivered)
2. Warning messages about events that legitimately can't be sent
3. Retry attempts for network/API failures

This strengthened system ensures **no event gets lost** and provides **full visibility** into the notification process.
